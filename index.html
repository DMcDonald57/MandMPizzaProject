        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. 
            We pull out all the stops, giving you the "wow" flavour, experience and 
            consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, 
            again, again, and again.
        </p>
        <p> We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop 
            serving two locaitons in the Edmonton area. When we’re not scouring the 
            globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, 
            we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. 
            From hot Hawaiians and classic cheese, to crispy wings and fresh apple pie, 
            everything at M amd M Stone Oven Pizza is baked with love. 
        </p>
        <p> After watching their parents run a very successful pizza business in Edmonton, sisters Miranda and Mackenzie,
            learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to M and M Stone Oven Pizza
            in 2018, the two sisters managed to grow their business, and in 2021 open a second location in St.Albert, Alberta
            and maintaning the traditional way of preparing pizza in traditional Stone Oven which adds a unique smokie
            flavor to the pizza which thier family perfected back in the mid 80s.
        </p>
        <p> M and M Stone Oven Pizza are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch 
            sauce and dough.  They even feature premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy 
            Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing
