        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. 
            We pull out all the stops, giving you the "wow" flavour, experience and 
            consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, 
            again, again, and again.
        </p>
        <p> We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop 
            serving two locations in the Edmonton area. When we’re not scouring the 
            globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, 
            we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. 
            From hot Hawaiians and classic cheese, to crispy wings and fresh apple pie, 
            everything at M amd M Brick Oven Pizza is baked with love. 
        </p>
        <p> After watching their parents run a very successful pizza business in Edmonton, sisters Miranda and Mackenzie,
            learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to M and M Brick Oven Pizza
            in 2018, the two sisters managed to grow and expand their business. In 2021 they opened a second location in St.Albert, Alberta
            while maintaining the traditional way of preparing pizza in the traditional Brick Oven. This method adds a unique smokie
            flavor to the pizza which their family perfected back in the mid 80's.
        </p>
        <p> M and M Brick Oven Pizza's are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch 
            sauce and dough.  They even feature premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy 
            Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing 
            we're always ready to make you more.
